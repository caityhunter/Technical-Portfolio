In this subfolder you will find screenshots of the main three pages of LitList.

1. Homepage -> this page has a slideshow that advertises LitList's main features
2. Community Page -> this page holds all user profiles; you can add new profiles, or edit/delete existing ones
3. Books page -> this page is LitList's book database, where users can choose to sort by title, genre, author, and page number, or--even easier--simply search for a book!
