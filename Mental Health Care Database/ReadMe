This folder contains my final project for my Database Design class, titled "Mental Health Care Database."  The project consisted of proposing an idea, developing an EERD and translating it the 3rd Normal Form, and creating the database in SQL.  It concludes with several queries that test the functionality of the database.

To view the full project, check out the document provided.  
Otherwise, browse the screenshots under the Screenshots folder for a quick overview.
